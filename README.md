## ATM Simulation
Welcome to the ATM Simulation project! This program simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that allows users to perform various banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, remitting, and changing PIN.

### Overview
This project aims to provide a basic understanding of how an ATM operates. It is a simple console-based application written in Python.

### Features
**Account Creation:** Users can create an account by providing their personal details such as name, mobile number, Aadhar card number, email address, and a 4-digit PIN.
**Minimum Balance Requirement:** The program enforces a minimum balance requirement of 100 units when opening a new account.
**Online Banking:** Users have the option to access online banking functionality, which includes depositing money, checking balance, withdrawing money, remitting, and changing PIN.
**Security Measures:** The program ensures the security of users' accounts by requiring authentication through a PIN. It also sends a message to the user's registered mobile number for withdrawal transactions.

### Steps to Execute
1) Install Python on your machine
2) Execute the atm_simulation.py file
